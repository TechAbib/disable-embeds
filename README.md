# Disable Embeds

WordPress plugin that disables the feature to embed WordPress posts from your site and others.

If you don't like the enhanced embeds that were introduced in WordPress 4.4 you can disable the feature using this plugin.

What this plugin does:

* Prevents others from embedding your site.
* Prevents you from embedding other non-whitelisted sites.
* Disables all JavaScript related to the feature.

Just activate the plugin and youâ€™re good to go.

Want embeds back again? Simply deactivate the plugin.
